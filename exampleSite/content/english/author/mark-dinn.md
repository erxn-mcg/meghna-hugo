Hi, I am Erin, the creator of Studi Cacti! I am currently a student trying to get my head around revision and personal growth. I decided to create this platform to _share_ my findings with others in similar positions, so everyone can grow together!

> Studi Cacti is a place for personal growth <3

Though it may seem like it for some, academic validation is not the only thing that means success in life! It is **so so so important** to take care of yourself as well, even it that just means journaling before bed, or lighting a candle once in a while, or reading a good book. A healthy mind is always ready to learn.

I hope you enjoy the platform, and maybe even begin your personal growth journey!

<3 Erin
